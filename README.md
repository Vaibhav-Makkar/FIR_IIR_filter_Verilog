# FIR_IIR_filter_Verilog
Implementation of FIR and IIR filters in Verilog HDL. 
Used Braun Unsigned Multiplier architecture to implement a 3-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. Introduced delays using D-flip flops and used Ripple Carry Adders for addition. Designed apt test benches to verify our design.
For Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, used Signed Baugh Wooley Multiplier Architecture for Multiplier Purpose by instantiation of half and full adders and AND gates.
